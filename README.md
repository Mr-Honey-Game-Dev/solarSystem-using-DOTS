# Solar System using DOTS

This Unity project is a solar system generator that can generate thousands of planets revolving around the sun. It is based on the Unity DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack) architecture, making it highly optimized and performant.

Features
Generate thousands of planets with unique properties, including radius, and distance from the sun.
Planets revolve around the sun with Elliptic orbit.
Generate trails for each planet to visualize their trajectory.
Highly optimized for performance, can support upto 3 thousand planets running at a decent 25-30fps.

Radius: the radius of the planet in kilometers.
Orbit Distance: the distance of the planet from the sun in millions of kilometers.
Orbit Speed: the speed at which the planet orbits the sun in kilometers per second.
Orbit Axis Ratio: the ratio of the semi-major axis to the semi-minor axis of the planet's elliptical orbit.
